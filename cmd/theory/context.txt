//Context
r.Context() is a method available on http.Request in the Go net/http package. It returns a context.Context instance that carries deadlines, cancelation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.


Define a Key Type:
A custom type key is defined to avoid collisions with other context values.

Create a New Context:
ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), userKey, "John Doe") creates a new context with the user value.

Pass the New Context:
r = r.WithContext(ctx) associates the new context with the request.

Retrieve the Value:
In the handler, the value is retrieved from the context using r.Context().Value(userKey).
